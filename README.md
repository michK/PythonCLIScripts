# PythonCLIScripts

A collection of Python Command Line Interface (CLI) scripts that I have found useful.

## Getting Started

To run the scripts, you will need the [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) Python module, which can be installed with

```
pip install click
```
## Usage

To use each script, simply run

```
python CLIScript.py arg1 arg2 arg3 etc
```

## Documentation

Each script is self-documented using the documentation functionality of Click. To see script functionality and required arguments, run

```
python CLIScript --help
```

## Brief description of script functionalities:
`fbconvert`: Convert Fitbit json data into csv for easier parsing and plotting.
