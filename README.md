# A collection of Python Command Line Interface (CLI) scripts to do various things that I have found useful.

## The [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) module has been used to create the scripts and the scripts are self-documenting.
## To see the script help simply do `python script.py --help`, this will give a
## description of the functionality and required arguments. The help screen also lists Python modules, apart
## from Click, that are required for the script to work.
