A collection of Python Command Line Interface (CLI) scripts to do various things that I have found useful.

The Click module has been used to create the scripts and the scripts are self-documenting using Clicks
documentation functionality. To see script help simply do `python script.py --help`, this will give a
description of the functionality and required arguments. The help screen also lists Python libraries, apart
from Click, that are required for the script to work.

Brief description of script functionalities:

- fbconvert: Convert fitbit json data into csv for easier parsing and plotting.
